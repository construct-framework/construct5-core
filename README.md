## Construct5 Core ##
Construct5 Core is the feature incubator, private test bed, and otherwise highly streamlined version of Construct5 Professional. 

This repo is private, and will likely remain private, so that we can use it to explore new ideas, techniques, and have a place to test things that may not be ready for public consumption. 

My plan is also to use this version for more highly customized solutions for clients (i.e. custom frameworks or parameter free templates). That said, I'd like to keep the 1-5 and 2-5 branches stable at all times. Please fork if need be, and submit pull requests for review to be merged, or branch as needed.

Enjoy!
