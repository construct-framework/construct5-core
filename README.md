## Construct5 Core ##
Construct5 Core is the feature incubator, test bed, and otherwise experimental version of Construct5 Professional. 

This repo is used it to explore new ideas, techniques, and have a place to test things that may not be ready for public consumption, or maybe they are.

That said, I'd like to keep the 1-5 and 2-5 branches stable at all times. Please fork if need be, and submit pull requests for review to be merged, or branch as needed.

Enjoy!
